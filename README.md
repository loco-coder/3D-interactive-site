# 3D-interactive-site

After a few months of playing around with HTML and JavaScript coding, 
Three.js for integrating 3D models into websites, 
orbit controls for rearranging the model using mouse controls,
scene development for placing camera view and spotlights,
and embedded Spotify playlists,
I have made a cool little 3D scene on a website that is the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars with the theme included!!!
